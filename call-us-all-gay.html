                <p>Its important to remember that we're all part of the LGBT+ community. Not part of the Gay community.</p>
                <p>Although some people who are LGBT+ may be okay with being called gay, gay is a specific lable and like all other lables don't always fit everyone</p>
                <p>If an LGBT+ person tells you that they're pansexual, aromantic or genderfluid that does <i>not</i> make them gay. That makes them whatever they've told you they are. </p>
                <p>The term 'gay' is no longer a catch all phrase to suite any LGBT+ person. Please don't use it as such </p>
