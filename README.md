# please-dont
A website with non-aggressive LGBT+ issue explanations for Cis/Het people

Please-Don't aims to provide easy, quick to read explanations to why some things cis/het people say to trans people are offensive and/or upsetting.

Please-Don't articles will be non-aggressive and targeted as being the page to link to when trying to explain something to a cis person.

We're targeting situations, especially on the internet, when you or someone else has been asked something that is commonly deemed to be intrusive, offensive, or hurtful.

**We want to keep the tone friendly and calm, making the explanation free of anger and aggression.**

I don't believe arguing in an aggressive way to be the best way of getting a cis (or any) person to understand and accept a point. Often they don’t realise they've offended you at all and don't understand why you’re upset.

While you may be upset and offended (and that's *totally* okay), responding with aggression to any argument is counter-productive to getting a person to accept the argument and make a change.

Please-Don't aims to provide little explanations that you can link to even if you’re annoyed. Hopefully this will make the person asking the offensive question understand what they've done!

##Call for Contributions
We want Please-Don't to be a collaborative project. We can't (and don't want to) do it on our own!

Please-Don't's maintainer, Samathy Barratt, will take contributions to [the Github repo](https://samathy.github.io/please-dont/) via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Samathy_Barratt), or via [email](mailto:samathy@sbarratt.co.uk).

I'm aiming for explanations to be around 200–300 concise words. I’ll play with this limit and see what works. Articles should contain citations and links where relevant and provide links for further reading.

Titles for the articles should be structured as short sentences preceded with "Please Don't". For example, "Please Don’t make a joke out of stating your pronouns".

If you need more information, several pages are live at [Please-Don't.info](http://www.please-dont.info).

Please, please get in contact if you’d like to write something!

##Current suggestions

I tweeted asking for some suggestions, and received these.
They’re not well formulated yet, but if you’d like to start working on full pieces for them, go ahead!!
* Pronouns are not a joke.
    * Making saying your pronouns a joke makes us a joke. We already struggle for people to accept our pronouns.
    * Don’t assume pronouns are obvious - especially yours.
* Don’t assume someone isnt trans
    * He might though! This is internalised transphobia
* We don’t want a massive apology.
    * If you get a name/pronoun wrong. Just say sorry and try harder. Don’t make it a big thing.
* Their name is their name. Deal with it.
    * Just listen to what they said their name is. (Don’t ask for old name)
* What is Non-Binary?
* Difference between transsexual and transgender
* They/Them are real pronouns.
* Don’t ask me if I’m going on hormones
* Don’t ask if I’m having surgery
* Don’t tell me I don't look trans
* Why gender neutral bathrooms are a good idea
* Asking which bathroom you use
* Insisting its their right to know information about you. (name, equipment)
* Being a woman doesn't mean I like very feminine things (clothing, colours)
* Don’t ignore my existence
* Don’t mention my deadname
    * Our deadnames are the names we were called before we came out, most likely birth names. Hearing them stings!
