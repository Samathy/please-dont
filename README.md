Do NOT contribute to the master branch.


###Contributing on Github

Contributing on Github is simple.

    * Fork the repo
    * Create a branch called 'Article-title-of-article' or 'Change-to-title-of-article'
    * Make a change to existing HTML or add a new page on that new branch
    * Submit a pull request with your patches. Pull request should be titled the same as your branch.

For articles you should use example.html as the skeleton for your article. 
It contains the correctly formatted header to keep the site consistent.
Copy example.html to a new file.

The new file should be named as title-of-your-article.html and stored in the root directory.

###Contributing outside of Github

    * You can go to [please-dont.info/submit.html](http://please-dont.info/submit.html) and submit your idea on the form there.
    * Send me an email to samathy[AT]sbarratt[dot]co[dot]uk with your change.
    * Tweet me
    * DM me
    * Contact me on Telegram @samathy

Articles should be around 200 to 300 words. They should provide links to relevent sources.
If you contribute an article outside of Github, don't worry about formatting, I'll do that for you.
The title of the article, should you choose to specify it yourself, should be in the form of a short sentence that continues on from "Please Don't .......".

Please Don't is a community project. I can't do it without you!

##Current suggestions

I tweeted asking for some suggestions, and received these.
They’re not well formulated yet, but if you’d like to start working on full pieces for them, go ahead!!
* Pronouns are not a joke.
    * Making saying your pronouns a joke makes us a joke. We already struggle for people to accept our pronouns.
    * Don’t assume pronouns are obvious - especially yours.
* Don’t assume someone isnt trans
    * He might though! This is internalised transphobia
* We don’t want a massive apology.
    * If you get a name/pronoun wrong. Just say sorry and try harder. Don’t make it a big thing.
* Their name is their name. Deal with it.
    * Just listen to what they said their name is. (Don’t ask for old name)
* What is Non-Binary?
* Difference between transsexual and transgender
* They/Them are real pronouns.
* Don’t ask me if I’m going on hormones
* Don’t ask if I’m having surgery
* Don’t tell me I don't look trans
* Why gender neutral bathrooms are a good idea
* Asking which bathroom you use
* Insisting its their right to know information about you. (name, equipment)
* Being a woman doesn't mean I like very feminine things (clothing, colours)
* Don’t ignore my existence
* Don’t mention my deadname
    * Our deadnames are the names we were called before we came out, most likely birth names. Hearing them stings!
