                <p>When someone is missgendered in an email or in verbal conversation, they can find this extremely upsetting. </p>
                <p>Getting misgendered because somone guessed is painful because it reminds us that we don't nessesarily look like the gender we are. </p>
                <p>So if you are not sure of which pronoun to use, then don't use them, or at least use gender neutral ones like they or them.</p>
                <p>This goes for verbal communication as well.</p>
