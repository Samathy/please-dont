                <p>Many people go under many different medical procedures for many different reasons.</p>
                <p>Some trans people have Gender Confirmation Surgery<sup>1</sup> but not all trans people do.</p>
                <p>Some babies have circumcisions, but not all babies do.</p>
                <p>When you go to the Doctors, you expect privacy, and if a stranger asks you what medical procedures you're having, you wouldn't want to answer</p>
                <p>Trans people, whether they're having surgery or not, want the same privacy.</p>
                <p>It's not appropriate to ask anyone, trans or cis, what genitals they have, so don't ask.</p>
                <p>By asking whether we've had, or are going to have surgery, you are invalidating that privacy, </p>
                <p>You are asking someone to disclose their private medical information to you, </p>
                <p>That information is personal, and there should be no obligtion to share it, so; Please Don't Ask If I'm Having Surgery </p>
                <br>
                <p><sup>1. Gender Confirmation Surgery is also known as Gender Recognition Surgery, Sex Reassignment Surgery, or Gender Reassignment Surgery. Please don't use the term "Sex Change".</sup></p>
