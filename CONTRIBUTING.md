#Contributing on Github

Contributing on Github is simple.

    * Fork the repo
    * Create a branch called 'Article-title-of-article' or 'Change-to-title-of-article'
    * Make a change to existing HTML or add a new page on that new branch
    * Submit a pull request with your patches. Pull request should be titled the same as your branch.

For articles you should use example.html as the skeleton for your article. 
It contains the correctly formatted header to keep the site consistent.
Copy example.html to a new file.

The new file should be named as title-of-your-article.html and stored in the root directory.


#Contributing outside of Github

    * Send me an email to samathy[AT]sbarratt[dot]co[dot]uk with your change.
    * Tweet me
    * DM me
    * Contact me on Telegram @samathy

Articles should be around 200 to 300 words. They should provide links to relevent sources.
If you contribute an article outside of Github, don't worry about formatting, I'll do that for you.
The title of the article, should you choose to specify it yourself, should be in the form of a short sentence that continues on from "Please Don't .......".


Please Don't is a community project. I can't do it without you!
