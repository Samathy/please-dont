            <div>
                <p>In English, we use the pronoun for a person that's correct for the self defined gender of the person (Remember, gender is not sex).</p>
                <p>That might be He, She, They, Xe, Zie or many others. (See <a href="http://pronoun.is">pronoun.is</a> for a nice list of common ones.) </p>
                <p>For cis people - their gender matches the gender assigned to them at birth (and probably matches their sex).</p>
                <p>This makes it very easy for people to guess what pronouns to be using for a cis person since they can easily tell what your gender is by what you look like and sound like. </p>
                <p>For a trans person, this probably isn't as easy for other people to tell. (This is a concept called 'Passing' )</p>
                <p>Because its harder to guess our pronouns trans people often have to state what their pronouns are, many put them on their social media profiles. </p>
                <p>So, why is it harmful when you make a joke out of stating our pronouns? </p>
                <p>To many cis people, trans people are already a joke. Having to state your pronouns is already a joke. </p>
                <p>By stating fake pronouns in your bio you're enforcing being trans as being a joke. </p>
                <p>You're making it more okay to make fun of us and making trans people even more ostracized. </p>
